## Methods to Implement

1. has_teen?

    A number is a teen if it is in the range 13 to 19 inclusive. Given three integers, return true if any of them are a teen.
2. not_string

    Given a string, return a new string where "not" has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not" return the original string unchanged.
3. icy_hot?

    It is icy if a temperature is less than zero, and it is hot if a temperature is greater than 100. Given two temperatures, return true if either one is icy and the other is hot.
4. closer_to

    Given a target number and two guesses, return the guess that is closer to the target. If they are the same distance, return 0.
5. two_as_one?
